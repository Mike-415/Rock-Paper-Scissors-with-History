# Rock-Paper-Scissors-with-History
The rock paper scissors game that uses navigation controllers, tab bar controllers, auto layout, and a table view to see the score rankings of previous games.

## Screen shots




## Requirements

# MVC
 a separate model class RPSGame should be used for the RPS game functionality

a separate model file should be used for your array of match results.  Do not put this array inside of a ViewController.

# Auto Layout

Use a vertical stack view for the three buttons for rock, paper, and scissors, and the label displaying the result.  The buttons and label should be evenly spaced from each other at a minimum of 10 points.

Using Auto Layout, center the stack view both horizontally and vertically in the Safe Area of the view.  It should always be centered no matter which device your app is running on, and whether it is in portrait or landscape mode.

Add a new label to the Game tab.  Using Auto Layout, it should be 10 points above the bottom of the Safe Area, and should be centered horizontally.  It should display a running total of wins, losses and ties.
